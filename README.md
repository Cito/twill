twill 2.0
---------

This fork is an attempt to create a more modern version 2.0 of twill based on the [lastest 1.8 version](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twill) which uses [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/) and [lxml](http://lxml.de/) instead of [mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/), plus ideas from other forks and add-ons like [retwill](https://bitbucket.org/brandizzi/retwill/) or [flunc](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/flunc/project-home).

Work is currently happening in the [2.0 branch](https://github.com/Cito/twill/tree/2.0) of this repository.

See the [changelog](https://github.com/Cito/twill/blob/2.0/doc/changelog.txt) for things that have been changed and improved already.
